# Analyzing Movie Data and Revenue

## What is our goal?
The goal of our project is to discover what factors of a movie most impact its revenue. Specifically, we will be examining the budget, popularity, original language and production country of over 5,000 movies. From this, we can analyze correlation and p values in order to determine which factor most impacts revenue.

## Where is our information coming from?
Our information is pulled from a .csv file from the TMDB, The Movie Database. The Movie Database contains information from media from all over the world and supports 39 different languages and provides support for over 180 countries.

The data was originally created from the Open Media Database (OMD). Like Wikipedia, OMD is curated by users who can submit corrections and additions as they see fit. The Movie DB adapted a similar process and movie lovers have been submitting data to the database since 2008.
